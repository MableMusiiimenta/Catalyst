                    When we were about to start the catalyst stage of our course, we were told that we would have some leadership classes. Little did we know that these would be serious self-checking,learning,re-learning and unlearning therapeutic sessions.Personally, I learnt and got to reflect on a lot of things that i never thought of before.

I am especially working on that area and concetrating more on Q2 these days where i read books and articles that help me grow,am exercising more and eating healthy,doing my research about my classwork and other things new things that i come across on a daily. I am also working on my personal relationships with my friends, family and partner,i am investing in Q2 to avoid Q1.</p>

        <p class="border border-5" style="text-align: center;">After these two weeks, I believe i am headed to the path of being a really "good person" lol.
          Currently, I am training myself to put all these great lessons i learnt into practice. Not that i was totally bad before these lessons,no, I was "alright", sort of, but life was hard with all emotions and attitudes involved on a daily. Now everything has been put to light and life is getting easier with this new knowledge.
          Also, i learnt that it's good practice to read/listen to books/podcasts about all life aspects,they help guide us through life's dynamics.
          Finally, I learnt that i am 100% in charge of my life, how i view things and of my decisions. Nobody is to blame!
          I now aim for proactivity in all aspects of my life instead of sitting around and be reactive as i wait for magic to happen and change my situation.</p></div>
